10-6: Addition
One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text 
instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError.
 Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result. 
 Catch the TypeError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error 
 message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text 
 .instead of a number.
